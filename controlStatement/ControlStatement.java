/*1.what control Statement
 *Control statement that change the normal flow of execution
 *
 *2.what is default flow of execution ?
 *sequential one line after next line is flow of execution
 *
 *3.Type of control statement 
 *	--> condition control statement
 *  --> un-condition control statement
 *  
 *4.what are condition control statement ?
 *That change flow of execution based on the truth value(either true or false) of a condition
 *
 *5.What is un-condition control statement ?
 *That change flow of execution without check the condition 
 *
 *6.classification of control statement 
 *
 *1) conditional (selective)
 *2) unconditional 
 *3) Interactive
 *
 *1.Selective (Decision Making) statement
 *	if
 *	if-else
 *  if -else ladder
 *  switch 
 *  
 *  They check a condition and choose which block of code should run
 *  
 *2.Un-condition
 *
 *	use to jump one part of program to another part without check the condition 
 *
 *	return 
 *	break
 *	continue
 *	ladder break 
 *	ladder continue
 *
 *3)Iterative (Looping) Statement
 *
 *Statement execute a set of statement repeatly until the desired condition is meet
 *
 *	For
 *	while
 *	do while
 *	Enhanced for-loop
 *
 *Switch Rule
 *
 *Allowed
 *
 *byte 
 *short 
 *int
 *char
 *String 
 *enum
 *
 *Not Allowed
 *long 
 *float
 *double 
 *boolean
 *			
 *Rule 1: Switch expression cannot have long float double and boolean data type
 *
 *Rule 2: Case statement can be appear jumble order
 *
 *Rule 3: Fall through happens if matching case statement doesn't have break statement 
 *				both is (good or bad base on condition)
 *
 *Rule 4: case value must be either be literal or constants
 *
 *Rule 5; Duplicate case statement are not allowed
 *
 *Rule 6: default case is optional in switch case
