/*1.What is Identifier ?
 *To identify various program element they give as name Such as variable,constant,Array name,String name
 *,method name,class name etc... 
 * 
 *Rules for Naming Identifiers
 *1.Identifiers  must start with character (or) dollar symbol  (or) They cannot start with digit

/*2. Naming Conversion
 * class ---> OneTwoThree{}
 * 
 * Interface ---> OneTwoThree{}
 * 
 * Method Name ---> oneTwoThree
 * 
 * variable ---> int oneTwoThree
 * 
 * package ---> oneTwoThree
 * 
 * 
 * 3.Constant ---> final int ONE_TWO =12;
 * 
 * 4.Advantage of Identifiers
 * It improve the readability of code there by making code easer to read

/* SourceFile
 *1.At most one public class.public class name must be the file name 
 * 
 *2.If file with no public class any name to the file 
 *
 *3.package statement must be first line in source code 
 *
 *4.Import statement between package and class
 *
 *5.Import statement apply to all the classes with source code file any of program
